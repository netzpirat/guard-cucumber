# Guard::Cucumber

Guard::Cucumber allows you to automatically run Cucumber features when files are modified.
It is tested on Ruby 1.8.7 & 1.9.2.

## Install

Please be sure to have [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) installed before continue.

Install the gem:

    gem install guard-cucumber

Add it to your `Gemfile`, preferably inside the test group:

    gem 'guard-cucumber'

Add the default Guard::Cucumber template to your `Guardfile` by running this command:

    guard init cucumber

## Usage

Please read the [Guard usage documentation](https://github.com/guard/guard#readme).

## Guardfile

Guard::Cucumber can be adapted to all kind of projects and comes with a default template that looks like this:

    guard 'cucumber' do
      watch(%r{features/.+\.feature})
      watch(%r{features/support/.+})                      { 'features' }
      watch(%r{features/step_definitions/(.+)_steps\.rb}) { |m| Dir[File.join("**/#{m[1]}.feature")][0] || 'features' }
    end

Expressed in plain English, this configuration tells Guard::Cucumber:

1. When a file within the features directory that ends in feature is modified, just run that single feature.
2. When any file within features/support directory is modified, run all features.
3. When a file within the features/step_definitions directory that ends in \_steps.rb is modified,
run the first feature that matches the name (\_steps.rb replaced by .feature) and when no feature is found,
then run all features.

Please read the [Guard documentation](http://github.com/guard/guard#readme) for more information about the Guardfile DSL.

## Options

You can pass any of the standard Cucumber CLI options using the :cli option:

    guard 'cucumber', :cli => '-c --drb --port 1234 --profile custom' do
      ...
    end

Former `:color`, `:drb`, `:port` and `:profile` options are thus deprecated and have no effect anymore.

### List of available options

    :cli => '-c -f pretty'            # Pass arbitrary Cucumber CLI arguments, default: nil
    :bundler => false                 # Don't use "bundle exec" to run the Cucumber command, default: true
    :rvm => ['1.8.7', '1.9.2']        # Directly run your features on multiple ruby versions, default: nil
    :notification => false            # Don't display Growl (or Libnotify) notification, default: true

## Spork configuration

To use Guard::Cucumber with [Spork](https://github.com/timcharper/spork) (preferabbly managed through
[Guard::Spork](https://github.com/guard/guard-spork)), be sure to include the `--drb` switch:

    guard 'cucumber', :cli => '--drb' do
      ...
    end
