# Guard::Cucumber

![travis-ci](http://travis-ci.org/netzpirat/guard-cucumber.png)

Guard::Cucumber allows you to automatically run Cucumber features when files are modified.

Tested on MRI Ruby 1.8.6, 1.8.7, 1.9.2 and the latest versions of JRuby & Rubinius.

## Install

Please be sure to have [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) installed before continue.

Install the gem:

    gem install guard-cucumber

Add it to your `Gemfile`, preferably inside the test group:

    gem 'guard-cucumber'

Add the default Guard::Cucumber template to your `Guardfile` by running this command:

    guard init cucumber

## Usage

Please read the [Guard usage documentation](https://github.com/guard/guard#readme).

## Guardfile

Guard::Cucumber can be adapted to all kind of projects and comes with a default template that looks like this:

    guard 'cucumber' do
      watch(%r{^features/.+\.feature$})
      watch(%r{^features/support/.+$})          { 'features' }
      watch(%r{^features/step_definitions/(.+)_steps\.rb$}) { |m| Dir[File.join("**/#{m[1]}.feature")][0] || 'features' }
    end

Expressed in plain English, this configuration tells Guard::Cucumber:

1. When a file within the features directory that ends in feature is modified, just run that single feature.
2. When any file within features/support directory is modified, run all features.
3. When a file within the features/step_definitions directory that ends in \_steps.rb is modified,
run the first feature that matches the name (\_steps.rb replaced by .feature) and when no feature is found,
then run all features.

Please read the [Guard documentation](http://github.com/guard/guard#readme) for more information about the Guardfile DSL.

## Options

You can pass any of the standard Cucumber CLI options using the :cli option:

    guard 'cucumber', :cli => '-c --drb --port 1234 --profile guard' do
      ...
    end

Former `:color`, `:drb`, `:port` and `:profile` options are thus deprecated and have no effect anymore.

### List of available options

    :cli => '--profile guard -c'      # Pass arbitrary Cucumber CLI arguments, 
                                      # default: '--no-profile --color --format progress --strict'

    :bundler => false                 # Don't use "bundle exec" to run the Cucumber command
                                      # default: true

    :rvm => ['1.8.7', '1.9.2']        # Directly run your features on multiple ruby versions
                                      # default: nil

    :notification => false            # Don't display Growl (or Libnotify) notification
                                      # default: true

    :all_after_pass => false          # Don't run all features after changed features pass
                                      # default: true

    :all_on_start => false            # Don't run all the features at startup
                                      # default: true

    :keep_failed => false             # Keep failed features until them pass
                                      # default: true

    :change_format => 'pretty'        # Use a different cucumber format when running individual features
                                      # This replaces the Cucumber --format option within the :cli option
                                      # default: nil

## Cucumber configuration

It's **very important** that you understand how Cucumber gets configured, because it's often the origin of
strange behavior of guard-cucumber.

Cucumber uses [cucumber.yml](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/cucumber.yml) for defining profiles
of specific run configurations. When you pass configurations through the `:cli` option but don't include a
specific profile with `--profile`, then the configurations from the `default` profile are also used.

For example, when you're using the default cucumber.yml generated by [cucumber-rails](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-rails),
then the default profile forces guard-cucumber to always run all features, because it appends the `features` folder.

### Configure Cucumber solely from Guard

If you want to configure Cucumber from Guard solely, then you should pass `--no-profile` to the `:cli` option.

Since guard-cucumber version 0.3.2, the default `:cli` options are:

    --no-profile --color --format progress --strict

This default configuration has been chosen to avoid strange behavior when mixing configurations form
the cucumber.yml default profile with the guard-cucumber `:cli` option.

You can safely remove `config/cucumber.yml`, since all configuration is done in the `Guardfile`.

### Use a separate Guard profile

If you're using different profiles with Cucumber then you should create a profile for Guard in cucumber.yml,
something like this:

    guard: --format progress --strict --tags ~@wip

Now you want to make guard-cucumber use that profile by passing '--profile guard` to the `:cli`.

## Cucumber with Spork

To use Guard::Cucumber with [Spork](https://github.com/timcharper/spork), you should install
[Guard::Spork](https://github.com/guard/guard-spork)) and use the following configuration:

    guard 'spork' do
      watch('config/application.rb')
      watch('config/environment.rb')
      watch(%r{^config/environments/.*\.rb$})
      watch(%r{^config/initializers/.*\.rb$})
      watch('spec/spec_helper.rb')
    end

    guard 'cucumber', :cli => '--drb --format progress --no-profile' do
      watch(%r{features/.+\.feature})
      watch(%r{features/support/.+})                      { 'features' }
      watch(%r{features/step_definitions/(.+)_steps\.rb}) { |m| Dir[File.join("**/#{ m[1] }.feature")][0] || 'features' }
    end
